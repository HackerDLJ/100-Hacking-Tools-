100 Top Ethical Hacking Tools and Software Tools In Cybersecurity

## What is Ethical Hacking?

  Ethical hacking (also called white-hat hacking) is a type of hacking in which the hacker has good intentions and the full permission of the target of their attacks. Ethical hacking can help organizations find and fix security vulnerabilities before real attackers can exploit them. If you’re interested in ethical hacking, the good news is that there’s a wealth of hacking tools you can use to learn the trade. This article will go over dozens of the top hacking tools and ethical hacking tools so that you can get started exploring.

## Are Hacking Tools the Same as Ethical Hacking Tools? Do Hackers Also Use Ethical Hacking Tools?

  The difference between hacking and ethical hacking isn’t the tools used but their motivations. Ethical hackers seek to help organizations fix their security vulnerabilities, while malicious hackers seek to exploit them for personal gain. Therefore, malicious hackers can use ethical hacking tools, and ethical hackers can use malicious hacking tools. In fact, some ethical hacking tools were originally developed by malicious hackers.

## Why Are Ethical Hacking Tools Important?

#### Ethical hacking tools are essential for several reasons:

 * They aid in risk management by helping organizations understand which parts of their IT ecosystem are most valuable and attractive to attackers.
 * They improve organizations’ compliance with data security and privacy regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR.
 * They strengthen organizations’ cybersecurity posture by offering insights into how to address security vulnerabilities, leading to fewer security incidents and reduced costs of cyberattacks.

## How Are Ethical Hacking Tools Useful for Cybersecurity Professionals?
  Ethical hacking tools are a crucial resource in the fight against malicious actors and cyber attacks. By using ethical hacking tools, IT security professionals can identify flaws in computer systems, applications, and networks before malicious actors discover them. If you are searching for the best hacking tools and ethical hacking tools, we have curated and categorized some of the best options based on the functionality they offer.
